Hi, I'm Jill Marbach—a New Jersey based marketer and graphic designer. I'm a recent graduate of The College of New Jersey actively seeking a full time digital marketing or graphic design role. I’m also open to doing freelance design projects. Below, you can view my designs and writing samples. If you want to see more of my work, I write [full length stories on Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/everything_author) and contribute [community articles on Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillmarbach). I recently wrote and designed a multimedia short story, [Cherry Picking](http://cherrypickingstory.site/).
