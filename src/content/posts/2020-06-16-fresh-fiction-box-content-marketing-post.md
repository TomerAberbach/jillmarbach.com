## Booked for the Week

A Book Review Blog by Jill Marbach

This Week’s Spotlight: *Conversations with Friends* by Sally Rooney

Genre: Contemporary Fiction

Goodreads Rating: 3.78 stars

This week, I’m reviewing Sally Rooney’s debut novel. I got this book courtesy of my April [Fresh Fiction box](https://www.freshfictionbox.com/). One of my favorite things about this box is getting books I would never pick up on my own. *Conversations with Friends* definitely fell into that category, but I’m so glad I had the chance to read it. This box also came with two other novels that will be featured in next week’s spotlight.

*Conversations with Friends* is about a lot of things: friendship, love, youth, sexuality, family, pain, and happiness. Reading it, I realized there’s not a particular focus on any one of those things. Instead, the book simply tells the story of a few months in a young girl’s life. Granted, it’s an eventful few months--Frances and her best friend, Bobbi, befriend a captivating and mysterious author, Melissa, and her actor husband, Nick. Frances begins to secretly pursue a relationship with Nick, a both exhilarating and painful experience for Frances and the reader. As the story goes on, four different relationships develop between each of the individuals involved in this messy foursome. Each is filled with love, lust, hatred, and growth. This book is beautifully written, and I especially related to it because, at her core, Frances is a confused millennial just trying to do her best.

I hope you enjoyed this review. If you want to follow along with what I’m reading each month, head over to [freshfictionbox.com](https://www.freshfictionbox.com/) for fun new books that are a surprise every time (at only $27.95 a month!). See you next week!
