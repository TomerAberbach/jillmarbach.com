This was a project for Design Fundamentals. Students will each be assigned 2 words. Your challenge is to design the word in a way that best expresses its meaning. Select a typeface(s) that will help to communicate the true expression of the word using typographic design. The instructor will attempt to assign words that will allow greater expression.
